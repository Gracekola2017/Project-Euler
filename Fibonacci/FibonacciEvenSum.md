# Fibonacci Even Sum

## Problem Statement
- Find the sum of all even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence that are less than or equal to the input number. 

## Input Format
- A single integer, `n`, where `n` is the upper bound of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Output Format
- A single integer, the sum of all even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence that are less than or equal to `n`.

## Constraints
* `n` will be a positive integer.
* `n` will be less than or equal to 4,000,000.

## Explanation
- The Fibonacci sequence is as follows: `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...`

- The even numbers in this sequence are: `2, 8, 34`

- The sum of these numbers is: `2 + 8 + 34 = 44`
